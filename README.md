# ESP8266 Motion Sensor to React Application

This repository provides a solution for connecting an ESP8266-based motion sensor to a React application using AWS IoT and a Cloud React Application. The ESP8266 board is used to detect motion using a sensor and streams the data to the React application, which then displays the motion events in real-time.

## Overview

The ESP8266 is a popular Wi-Fi enabled microcontroller board that can be programmed to interact with various sensors and devices. In this project, we utilize the ESP8266 board to detect motion using a motion sensor (e.g., PIR sensor) and send the motion data to a React application.

The React application provides a user-friendly interface to display the motion events in real-time. The application can be customized to suit your specific requirements and integrate with other systems as needed.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, please follow the setup instructions provided in the next section. These instructions will guide you through the necessary hardware and software requirements, as well as the steps for configuring and running the application.

## Hardware Requirements

To complete this project, you will need the following hardware:

1. ESP8266 board (e.g., NodeMCU, Wemos D1 Mini)
2. Motion sensor (e.g., PIR sensor)
3. Breadboard and jumper wires
4. USB cable for programming and powering the ESP8266 board

## Software Requirements

The software components required for this project are:

1. Arduino IDE (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
2. Node.js and npm (https://nodejs.org)

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Connect the motion sensor to the ESP8266 board according to the provided schematic or wiring diagram.
3. Open the Arduino IDE and install the required libraries for the ESP8266 board and motion sensor.
4. Configure the Wi-Fi credentials and any other necessary settings in the Arduino sketch provided.
5. Upload the Arduino sketch to the ESP8266 board.
6. Navigate to the `react-app` directory in the cloned repository.
7. Install the React application dependencies by running `npm install` in the command line.
8. Configure the necessary environment variables or settings in the React application.
9. Build the React application using `npm run build`.

## Running the Application

Once you have completed the setup instructions, follow these steps to run the application:

1. Power up the ESP8266 board and ensure it is connected to the Wi-Fi network.
2. Start the React application by running `npm start` in the `react-app` directory.
3. Access the React application in your web browser at the provided URL.
4. The motion events detected by the ESP8266 board should now be displayed in real-time in the React application.
